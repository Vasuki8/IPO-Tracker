## Interpretation

- **Not yet disclosed** is not treated as a data-quality failure for pre-exchange filings.
- **Collector gap** means an official field is expected and recoverable for that lifecycle/source class but remains missing.
- Fresh/OFS composition is not counted as an archival collector gap unless a qualifying offer document exists.
- Allotment dates remain visible as optional research coverage rather than inflating the actionable queue without a reliable official historical source.
- Recent exchange coverage is the best measure of whether the live collectors are working well today.
- Historical lot size and issue size are progressively repaired from the official BSE historical archive when available.
